Covid-19 Tracker by Anton Koenig, 2020
An interactive geographical data visualization of corona virus hotspots (states, counties, cities, colleges) and vaccination sites powered by Esri and Leaflet.
Users can view cases, deaths, recoveries and tests over time in a responsive Chart.js module. While some data is retrived live from government and/or public
databases, most of it is a mix of client-side and server-side randomly generated data in a predefined JSON format (for demonstration purposes).
